# PebbleOS
This is the latest version of the internal repository from Pebble Technology providing the software to run on Pebble watches. Proprietary source code has been removed from this repository and it will not compile as-is. This is for information only.

This is not an officially supported Google product. This project is not eligible for the Google Open Source Software Vulnerability Rewards Program.

# Restoring the Directory Structure
To clarify the licensing of third party code, all non-Pebble code has been moved into the third_party/ directory. A python script is provided to restore the expected structure. It may be helpful to run this script first:

./third_party/restore_tree.py
# Missing Components
Some parts of the firmware have been removed for licensing reasons, including:

# All of the system fonts
The Bluetooth stack, except for a stub that will function in an emulator
The STM peripheral library
The voice codec
# ARM CMSIS
For the Pebble 2 HR, the heart rate monitor driver
Replacements will be needed for these components if you wish to use the corresponding functionality.
